How to use it?

This app is a simulation of a bank app (like PayPal), there are 4 users:
1. Esteban Hidalgo -> user: eh -> PIN: 1111
2. Jessica Davis -> user: jd -> PIN: 2222
3. Steven Thomas Williams user: stw -> PIN: 3333
4. Sarah Smith -> user: ss -> PIN: 4444

You can log in as any user and transfer money between each user, request a loan, or even close the account.

The users and the movements are dynamically added and the dates and timers will automatically refresh.

When transferring the money just log in as that user to see his / her profile.

The user will be automatically logged out if there isn't any movement in 5min.
